# credit2.0
Checks whether a credit card is valid and whether it is AMEX, VISA or MASTERCARD.
Using the Luhn algorithm and some AMEX, VISA and MASTERCARD card standards, the program is capable of checking whether the card numbering is valid (you should not trust it completely, taking into account that it is possible to generate a non-existent card number that meets to the algorithm) and what your brand is.
